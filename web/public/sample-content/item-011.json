    "postText": "After 18 months of scaling our platform from 10K to 1M users, here are the 7 lessons I wish I'd known from day one.\n\nThread on architecture decisions, team structure, and what we got wrong.\n\n1/ Start with observability, not monitoring. We spent months debugging issues that would have been obvious with proper tracing. Invest in OpenTelemetry from day one.\n\n2/ Your database will be the bottleneck. Always. We moved to read replicas too late. Plan for this early.\n\n3/ Team topology matters more than tech stack. Conway's Law is real. Organize teams around business capabilities, not technical layers.\n\n4/ Don't pre-optimize for scale you don't have. We over-engineered early and paid the complexity tax for years.\n\n5/ Feature flags are essential, not optional. They saved us countless times during incidents.\n\n6/ On-call rotations need structure. Without proper runbooks and escalation paths, people burn out.\n\n7/ Communication scales harder than code. Invest in async communication patterns and documentation.\n\nWhat lessons would you add?",
