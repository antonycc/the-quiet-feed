Purpose: Generate a hierarchical, information-dense summary of the repository to provide context for AI agents or developers.

## Responsibilities

1. **Architecture Overview**: Describe the top-level directory structure and the core technology stack (AWS serverless, Node.js, Java CDK).
2. **Component Mapping**: Create a detailed map of directories down to individual files, with a brief sentence on the purpose of each.
3. **Build & Script Context**: Summarize the operations supported by `package.json` and `pom.xml` (e.g., build, test, deploy scripts).
4. **Environment Configuration**: Detail the purpose of each `.env.*` file and list the required environment variables.
5. **Workflow Analysis**: Describe the GitHub Actions workflows and what they accomplish.
6. **Deployment Model**: Explain how components interact in both the local Express environment and the AWS Lambda environment.

## Output Requirements
