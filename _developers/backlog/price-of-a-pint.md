That instinct is sound, and it’s the right level to be thinking at. The key point is this:

**“Incidental purchase” is not a number, it’s a *decision threshold*.**

Below that threshold, people do not deliberate; above it, they justify.

## What “incidental purchase” means in the UK (2025)

In the UK today, for most adults:

* **£0–£4** → frictionless
* **£4–£7** → incidental / impulse
* **£7–£12** → light deliberation
* **£12–£20** → justification required
* **£20+** → procurement mindset

The *pint* is a good proxy not because it’s beer, but because:

* It is bought **without planning**
* It is **price-salient**
* It has **regional variance but national familiarity**

The important part:

> People *notice* pint prices, but they do **not optimise** them.

## What happens psychologically below the incidental threshold

When a price is below the incidental threshold:

* Users do not compare competitors
* Users do not delay purchase
* Users do not seek approval
* Users tolerate small UX or onboarding friction
* Churn is driven by *usefulness*, not *price*

This is exactly where you want first-time compliance users to be.

## Why “just below the pint” works — but only abstractly

If the average pint is ~£5.20:

* £4.99 or £5.99 **both feel “about a pint”**
* £5.17 feels like **a calculation**, not a choice
* £6.99 feels like “two pints territory” psychologically

So the **relative position**, not the precision, matters.

## Specific to VAT / compliance software

Here’s the crucial nuance:

People do **not** treat compliance software like entertainment.

They ask:

* “Will this get me fined?”
* “Will this break when HMRC changes something?”
* “Will support exist if it goes wrong?”

If the price is *too* incidental, users infer:

* “This might be a toy”
* “This might disappear”
* “This might not be supported”

There is a **lower bound of seriousness**.

## Practical sweet spots (UK)

Given your goals, there are only three rational choices:

### Option A — Incidental-first positioning

**£5.99/month**

* Below serious deliberation
* Still intentional
* Strong for self-serve micro-businesses
* Risk: perceived as “cheap tool”

### Option B — Serious but painless (recommended)

**£12.99/month**

* Still cheap relative to penalties/accountants
* Clears “serious software” bar
* Users don’t churn over price
* Better for long-term trust

### Option C — Dual framing

* **£5.99** for “submission-only”
* **£12.99** for “ongoing compliance / history / support”

---

## Key takeaway

If your aim is *purely* to sit below the incidental purchase threshold:

* You want **a round number slightly below a culturally salient spend**
* You do **not** want a literal index
* You want **familiarity, not cleverness**

**£5.99 achieves that. £5.17 does not.**

And for tax software, clever pricing is a liability.
