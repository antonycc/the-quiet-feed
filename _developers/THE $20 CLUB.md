# THE $20 CLUB: BELIEVER PRICING MODEL

> *"The price of Claude Pro for a bet on something quieter."*

---

## The Model

```
Phase 1: THE $20 CLUB
├─ Founders pay $20/month (~£16)
├─ Full HARD COPY access from day one
├─ Funds the build at high margin
└─ Continues until WAR CHEST TRIGGER

WAR CHEST TRIGGER:
├─ When: 1 month's PROFIT ≥ 24 months of COSTS
├─ All founders go FREE (lifetime HARD COPY)
└─ Price drops to 10% MARGIN with $2 FLOOR

Phase 2: THE QUIET MACHINE
├─ Price = max($2, whatever maintains 10% margin)
├─ Price floats DOWN as scale increases (but never below $2)
├─ Surplus above 10% builds resilience
└─ Proportional, sustainable, not extractive
```

## The Four Numbers

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **$20/month** | Founder price during build phase |
| **24× costs** | War chest trigger—1 month profit covers 2 years runway |
| **10% margin** | Post-trigger pricing target |
| **$2/month floor** | Price never drops below this; surplus builds resilience |

---

## Why $20?

**Accessible but committed.** $20/month is:
- The same as Claude Pro—users have a mental model for this
- Low enough that people will try an unproven product
- High enough that founders have skin in the game
- Less than Netflix + Spotify combined

**Not $10:** Too cheap. Trigger never fires at reasonable scale. Doesn't filter for believers.

**Not $100:** Too expensive for an idea-stage startup. Filters out great early adopters who can't justify $100/month on a bet. Creates "startup tax" resentment when price drops to $2.

---

## Trigger Mechanics

**The trigger fires when:** `monthly_profit >= monthly_costs × 24`

This means a single month's profit covers 2 years of runway. War chest complete. Founders rewarded.

### Path to Trigger

| Scale | Monthly Cost | 24× Trigger | Founders @ 2% | Revenue | Profit | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|--------|--------|
| 10,000 | £905 | £21,720 | 200 | £3,200 | £2,295 | Building |
| 25,000 | £1,500 | £36,000 | 500 | £8,000 | £6,500 | Building |
| 50,000 | £1,900 | £45,600 | 1,000 | £16,000 | £14,100 | Building |
| 100,000 | £2,280 | £54,720 | 2,000 | £32,000 | £29,720 | Building |
| 200,000 | £3,200 | £76,800 | 4,000 | £64,000 | £60,800 | Building |
| 300,000 | £4,000 | £96,000 | 6,000 | £96,000 | £92,000 | 96% there |
| **400,000** | £4,800 | £115,200 | 8,000 | £128,000 | **£123,200** | **TRIGGER ✓** |

**Trigger fires at ~400,000 users with ~8,000 $20 Club founders.**

At that moment:
- You bank ~£123,000 (the war chest—covers 2+ years of costs)
- All 8,000 founders go FREE forever
- Price drops to 10% margin (hits $2 floor immediately at this scale)

## Build Phase Economics

What you have to work with while building:

| Scale | Monthly Profit | Annual Runway | Notes |
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 10,000 users | £2,295 | £27,540 | Ramen profitable |
| 25,000 users | £6,500 | £78,000 | One salary |
| 50,000 users | £14,100 | £169,200 | Comfortable solo |
| 100,000 users | £29,720 | £356,640 | Small team possible |
| 200,000 users | £60,800 | £729,600 | Real business |

This is healthier than the $100 club—more gradual growth, less dependent on a small number of high-payers, sustainable build pace.

---

## Post-Trigger Pricing

Once founders go free, price drops to whatever maintains 10% margin, with a $2/month floor.

**Formula:** `price = max($2, (monthly_cost / 0.9) / paying_subscribers)`

| Scale | Monthly Cost | 10% Margin Price | Floored Price | Actual Margin | Monthly Profit |
|-------|-------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| 400,000 | £4,800 | £0.67 | **$2 (£1.60)** | 73% | £7,960 |
| 500,000 | £5,000 | £0.56 | **$2 (£1.60)** | 76% | £11,000 |
| 1,000,000 | £10,570 | £0.59 | **$2 (£1.60)** | 75% | £21,430 |
| 5,000,000 | £30,000 | £0.33 | **$2 (£1.60)** | 84% | £130,000 |
| 10,000,000 | £59,760 | £0.33 | **$2 (£1.60)** | 84% | £260,240 |
| 100,000,000 | £384,060 | £0.21 | **$2 (£1.60)** | 89% | £2,815,940 |

**The $2 floor means:** Once you pass ~400K users, price stays at $2 and margin grows. The surplus builds resilience, funds experiments, ensures independence.

---

## What The $2 Floor Creates

At scale with the $2 floor:

| Scale | Price | Monthly Profit | Annual Profit | What It Funds |
|-------|-------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 500K | $2 | £11,000 | £132,000 | Independence |
| 1M | $2 | £21,430 | £257,160 | Small team |
| 10M | $2 | £260,240 | £3,122,880 | Never compromise |
| 100M | $2 | £2,815,940 | £33,791,280 | Fund 10 more quiet projects |

**This isn't greed—it's recognition that:**
1. $2/month is already incredibly cheap (less than a coffee)
2. Below $2, the price becomes meaningless
3. The surplus funds resilience, not extraction

## Founder Journey

### What Founders Experience

**Month 1-24: The Build**
```
You're paying: $20/month
You're getting: Full HARD COPY access
You're part of: A community of believers funding something new
Your risk: $480 total if it fails completely
```

**Trigger Month (~Month 24-36 at current projections):**
```
Notification: "The war chest is complete. Thank you for believing."
Your new price: $0/month, forever
Your status: Founding member (永久)
The product: Now serving 400,000+ users
```

**Forever After:**
```
You pay: Nothing
Everyone else pays: $2/month
Your status: Visible founding member badge
Your access: Full HARD COPY, forever
```

### The Math of Being a Founder

If trigger fires at month 30:
- Total paid: 30 × $20 = $600
- Lifetime value received: ∞ (free forever)
- Break-even vs $2/month: 25 years

If you'd waited for $2 pricing:
- You'd pay $2/month forever
- At 25 years: $600 (same as founder total)
- But: No founding status, no input on roadmap, no "I was there" story

**Founders get:** Early access + lifetime free + status + community
**Founders risk:** $20/month on something that might not work

---

## Community Economics

### 8,000 Founders at Trigger

At 400K users with 2% conversion to $20 Club:
- 8,000 founders
- Small enough to be a community
- Large enough to be representative
- Diverse enough to avoid groupthink

Compare to $100 Club:
- 500 founders at trigger
- More exclusive, but less diverse
- Higher individual commitment, but smaller collective

### Post-Trigger: Founders as Evangelists

8,000 people who:
- Paid $20/month for 2+ years
- Now get lifetime free
- Have "founding member" status
- Are genuinely grateful

This is your marketing. These people will tell others. They have a story: "I believed early, and it paid off."

---

## Comparison: $20 vs $100 Club

| Metric | $20 Club | $100 Club |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Monthly price | £16 | £80 |
| Trigger scale | ~400K users | ~25K users |
| Founders at trigger | ~8,000 | ~500 |
| Time to trigger (est.) | 2-3 years | 1-2 years |
| Build revenue at 50K users | £14K/month | £38K/month |
| Accessibility | High | Low |
| Founder diversity | High | Lower |
| "Startup tax" feeling | Mild (10×) | Strong (50×) |
| Post-trigger resentment risk | Low | Medium |

### Why $20 Wins

1. **Claude Pro mental model** — Users know what $20/month for AI feels like
2. **Accessible believers** — More people can justify $20 than $100
3. **Healthier trigger** — 400K users is real traction, not a lucky niche
4. **Better community** — 8,000 diverse founders > 500 wealthy ones
5. **Less resentment** — $20 → $2 feels fair; $100 → $2 feels like you got played
6. **Sustainable build** — Revenue grows with users, not dependent on whales

---

## Risk Scenarios

### What if we never hit 400K users?

Options:
1. **Lower the trigger** — At 200K users, profit is £60K/month. Could trigger at 12× costs instead of 24×.
2. **Time-box it** — "After 36 months, founders go free regardless." Caps founder risk.
3. **Graceful wind-down** — If it's clearly not working at 100K users after 3 years, return remaining month pro-rata and shut down honestly.

### What if conversion is 1% instead of 2%?

| Scale | Founders @ 1% | Revenue | Profit | Trigger? |
|-------|---------------|---------|--------|----------|
| 400,000 | 4,000 | £64,000 | £59,200 | ✗ |
| 600,000 | 6,000 | £96,000 | £90,500 | ✗ |
| **800,000** | 8,000 | £128,000 | **£121,000** | **✓** |

At 1% conversion, trigger fires at ~800K users instead of 400K. Still achievable, just takes longer.

### What if a founder churns before trigger?

- They lose founding status
- If they rejoin later, they're a regular $20 Club member (or post-trigger $2 member)
- No refunds, no credit for previous payments
- Founding status requires staying until trigger

## The $20 Club: Final Summary

```
THE $20 CLUB

$20/month while we build.
The price of Claude Pro for a bet on something quieter.

You get:
├─ Full HARD COPY access from day one
├─ Lifetime FREE when trigger fires
│   (1 month's profit ≥ 24 months of costs)
├─ Founding member status forever
└─ No ads, ever

Trigger estimate: ~400,000 users / ~8,000 founders
Post-trigger price: $2/month (10% margin, $2 floor)
Your total risk: ~$600 if you stay until trigger

No cap on members.
More founders = faster trigger = everyone wins.

## The Four Numbers (Final)

| Number | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **$20/month** | Founder price—Claude Pro equivalent, accessible but committed |
| **24× costs** | War chest trigger—1 month profit covers 2 years runway |
| **10% margin** | Post-trigger target—sustainable, not extractive |
| **$2 floor** | Minimum price—surplus builds resilience |

*"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."*

*Unlike Roy's memories, the $20 you pay each month compounds into something that lasts. When the trigger fires, you're not just a user—you're part of why it exists.*

**The Quiet Feed. Enhance. Stop.**
