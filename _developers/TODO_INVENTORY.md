## Executive Summary

This document catalogs all TODO and FIXME markers in the repository, plus additional cleanup opportunities identified during code review. Items are organized into themed delivery packages suitable for AI agent execution. Each package is sized to be completable in a single PR and ordered by impact and complexity.

### Verification

**Search Command Used:**
```bash
grep -r -n -E '//\s*TODO|//\s*FIXME|#\s*TODO|#\s*FIXME|<!--\s*TODO|<!--\s*FIXME' \
  --include="*.js" --include="*.java" --include="*.html" --include="*.yml" --include="*.yaml" \
  . 2>/dev/null | grep -v node_modules | grep -v target | grep -v '.git/' | \
  grep -v 'test-report' | grep -v '.github/agents' | grep -v 'prompts/' | grep -v 'eslint.config.js'
```

**Counts:**
- Code files (JS, Java, HTML, YAML): 25 TODO markers
- Markdown documentation files: 4 TODO markers
- **Total explicit TODOs: 29 markers**

However, during the inventory process, one additional item was identified that represents the same TODO context:
- Item 29 "### TODO for approval" is a section header representing the same work as items 27-28

**Adjusted count: 29 unique TODO markers, represented as 30 items in the table for granularity**

**Additional cleanup opportunities identified:**
- 5 functions marked with `eslint-disable-next-line no-unused-vars`
- 3 blocks of commented-out code
- **Total additional items: 8**

**Grand Total: 37 actionable items**

## Notes for AI Agent Execution

### Package Sizing Philosophy

Each package is sized to be completable within a single PR by an AI agent similar to GitHub Copilot. Sizing considers:
- **Scope:** Number of files and LOC changed
- **Complexity:** Architectural understanding required
- **Testing:** Types and duration of tests needed
- **Risk:** Potential for breaking changes

### Testing Strategy per Package

- **Unit-only packages (0, 1, 5):** Run `npm run test:unit` (~4s)
- **System packages (9):** Run `npm test` (~10s)
- **CDK packages (1, 4, 12):** Run `./mvnw clean verify` (~2min)
- **Behaviour packages (2, 3, 7, 8):** Run `npm run test:allBehaviour` (~5-10min)
- **Full validation:** Run all three test suites in sequence

### Dependency Graph

```
Package 0 (Cleanup) → Can be done independently
Package 1 (Infra Cleanup) → Can be done independently
Package 2 (Test Assertions) → Can be done independently
Package 3 (File Org) → Can be done independently
Package 4 (Workflow) → Depends on Package 1 (shared names)
Package 5 (HEAD Fix) → Can be done independently
Package 6 (Docs) → Depends on Package 11 (MFA) for complete evidence
Package 7 (Non-Sandbox) → Can be done independently
Package 8 (Flaky Tests) → May depend on Package 7
Package 9 (Anonymization) → Can be done independently
Package 10 (RUM) → Can be done independently
Package 12 (LambdaNames) → Should be done last, depends on stable state
```

### Recommended Execution Order

1. **Package 0** - Cleanup (reduces noise)
2. **Package 1** - Infrastructure Cleanup (enables Package 4)
3. **Package 2** - Test Assertions (improves test reliability)
4. **Package 5** - HEAD Request Fix (simple correctness fix)
5. **Package 3** - File Organization (simple refactor)
6. **Package 4** - Workflow Improvements (deployment safety)
7. **Package 7** - Non-Sandbox Testing (enables Package 8)
8. **Package 8** - Fix Flaky Tests (test reliability)
9. **Package 9** - Receipt Anonymization (compliance)
11. **Package 6** - Documentation (requires Package 11 complete)
12. **Package 10** - RUM Re-integration (observability)
13. **Package 12** - LambdaNames Refactor (major refactor, do last)
