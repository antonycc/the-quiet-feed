> Formatting and style: Follow the repo tools — ESLint (flat) + Prettier for JS (ESM) and Spotless (Palantir Java Format) for Java. Use npm run formatting / npm run formatting-fix. See README for links and IDE setup.
> Do not apply styles changes to code that you are not otherwise changes and prefer to match the existing local style when applying the style guides would be jarring.
